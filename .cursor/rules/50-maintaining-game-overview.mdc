description: Keep GameOverview.md accurate when features are added or core functionality changes

### Maintain GameOverview.md

Purpose: Ensure `GameOverview.md` stays in sync with the codebase.

If a diagram changes, update the corresponding Mermaid block in `GameOverview.md`. Prefer precise node names matching system/function names.

#### How to update quickly
1) Revise or add bullets; keep language concise
2) Update Mermaid nodes/edges; ensure names match code (e.g., `goal_selection_system`)
3) Save and preview rendering; fix any Mermaid syntax issues

#### Style guidelines
- Keep it concise and task‑oriented; avoid internal implementation detail unless crucial
- Prefer lists and small diagrams over long prose

#### Reviewer checklist
- [ ] Do diagrams and text match the actual order in `src/main.rs`?
- [ ] Are new systems/components/resources reflected?
- [ ] Are input/camera or UI changes captured?
- [ ] Does the wording help a newcomer understand “what it does” and “where it lives”?
